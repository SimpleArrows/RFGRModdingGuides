## Questions and Help
Have any questions about modding that the guides don't cover, need help with something, or just want to find other rfg modders and players? The [official Red Faction discord server](https://discord.gg/RDsQKU8), also linked below, is the place to go. There's a fair amount of active users there who should be able to help you out when they get the chance. You should also check out the [Faction Files discord server](https://discord.gg/fRrUzuV). It's more focused on RF1, but holds an active community of fans of the Red Faction series.

## Contributing
Feel free to improve existing guides or write your own in the [wiki](https://github.com/SimpleArrows/RFGRModdingGuides/wiki) section. You're not required to ask a guide's maintainer before changing it, but it's courteous to do so if possible. If you want ideas on guides to write or improvements to be made, check out the [issues](https://github.com/SimpleArrows/RFGRModdingGuides/issues) section.
